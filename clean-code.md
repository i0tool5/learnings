# Commentaries

## 1: Inappropriate information
It is not appropriate to post information in the comments section that would be more convenient to store in other sources. Comments must be reserved for technical information about the code and its architecture.

## 2: Outdated comment
Comments are considered obsolete if they are no longer provide up-to-date information about the code they once described..

## 3: Redundant comment
A comment is considered redundant if it describes something that is already obvious. Ð¡omments should "say" what the code itself can't "say".

## 4: poorly written comment
A poorly written comment is worse than no comment at all. The comment should be precise, concise, meaningful and as brief as possible.

## 5: commented code
If you encounter commented code, you can safely delete it.

# Functions

## 1: Too many arguments
Functions must have a small number of arguments. It is recommended to have no more than 3 arguments.

## 2: Output argument passing
Arguments are used to convey input rather than output information. It is unnatural to pass what the function should return as an argument.

## 3: Argument flags
Logical arguments explicitly indicate that the function performs more than one operation. They significantly confuse the code.

## 4: Unused functions
Unused code must be deleted. Always.
